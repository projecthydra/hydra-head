# *Using this Module is not necessary if you're writing Controllers in Rails3.*  
# In a Rails3 app, simply define regular Rails Controllers to expose the Resources & Actions you need and use Hydra::Controller to add Hydra support.
# For search & discovery in those apps, use Blacklight and customize the "index" partials for each type of content to include links to the show/edit actions of the corresponding Controllers.
#
# This Module extends Blacklight Catalog behaviors to give you a "Hydra" Catalog with edit and show behaviors on top of the Blacklight search behaviors.
# Include this module into any of your Blacklight Catalog classes (ie. CatalogController) to add Hydra functionality.
